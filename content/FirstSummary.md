# Summary so far

Before we continue with our journey, we should briefly summarize the concepts we learned so far.

### Python Basics

We learned...

that python is a easy access, user-friendly general purpose programming language.

that we can use python like a calculator, using mathematical operations.

about different datatypes (float, integer, strings,logicals)

how to use if/else clauses 

how to compare different variables using logical operators (<, >, >=, <=, ==, != )

### Loops

We learned...

that we can use for loops to iterate through `lists`. 

how to apply if/else clauses in for loops

what the enumerate function does

what while loops are and how to use them

### Functions and Modules

We learned...

how to define and use a function

how to properly add documentation to our functions

what packages and modules are


##

Next would be to learn more about specific data structures (numpy arrays, pandas dataframes) and how to visualize your data.
